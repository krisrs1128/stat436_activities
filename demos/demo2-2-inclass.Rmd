[Olympics Derivations] This problem gives some practice with deriving and visualizing new variables.

```{r}
olympics <- read_csv("https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l.csv")
olympics
```

a. Create new columns for the city and country of birth for each athlete in the
London 2012 Olympics
[dataset](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/rzw8h2x6dp5693gdbpgxaf2koqijo12l).

```{r}
olympics |>
  mutate(
    birth_city = str_split(`Place of birth`, "\\(")
  ) |>
  select(Name, `Place of birth`, birth_city) |>
  unnest_wider(birth_city, "_") |>
  rename(birth_city = birth_city_1) |>
  select(-birth_city_2)

test$birth_city[1:5]

```


b. Compute the standard deviation of athlete age within each sport. Which sport
has widest SD in age?

```{r}
olympics |>
  group_by(Sport) |>
  summarise(sd_age = sd(Age), num_athletes = n()) |>
  arrange(-sd_age)

```

c. Make a visualization of sports against participant age. Sort sports by
age variance.

```{r}
ggplot(olympics) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(Age, reorder(Sport, Age, sd)))
```
